                   This is the WORST class I have ever taken at A&m- I do not recommend this teacher, he is getting older and needs to retire. The tests are tricky and worded oddly, and the material is very, very advanced for a 101 class. Do NOT take Hall!
                
                   prof is very hard to understand even with mic, but the class is super easy if you can get a hold of the old tests because the questions are almost identical
                
                   A good hearted Profesor, but he is difficult to understand even with a mic, and often the exams include information not in textbook or given powerpoints.
                
                   Horrible prof! He may have been good years ago, but this guy is WAY past his prime. He mumbles, and even with a mic, you still can't understand him. Going to class is pointless. Exams are ridiculously hard. Avg scores were 60's. Hope for a good curve and do good in lab is all I have to say.

                   This class is one of the most demanding classes I have taken at TAMU. I loved the class but note: Its very hard!
                
                   Labs are twice a week. It's only a four credit hour class, but it feels like I spend more than eight hours in class and who knows how much out of class. It's very very VERY demanding. Dr. Hatch is really nice and very passionate about plant taxonomy and grasses.
