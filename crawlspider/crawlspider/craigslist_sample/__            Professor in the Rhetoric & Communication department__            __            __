                   She is friendly, and very upbeat, which makes this class better. The class is hard, but she gives a study guide, which is very helpful and straight forward with the tests. She will even sometimes in class tell you what she will put on the test. She can be confusing, and she talks super fast, but she's willing to help. You have to go to class.
