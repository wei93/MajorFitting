                   Pollard is a very clear, concise prof.  He always stresses the important points a expects from his students the same that would be expected from them if they worked for an architectural firm.  Rumor has it that his tests are evil, but he's done away with them (since they don't give tests or quizzes in a firm). Awesome guy, very chill!
