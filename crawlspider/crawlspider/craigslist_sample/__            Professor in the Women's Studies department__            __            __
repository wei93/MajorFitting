She talks and elaborates on the material and also poses questions and encourages the students to make comments and discuss. If you read and study the material the tests should not be hard at all to pass and make an A on.
                
                   The readings are a little hard but I learned a lot.

                   I enjoyed Dr. Wolf's class.  she may seem unapproachable, but she's really quite nice.  if you read sometimes, go to class, and go to a few SI sessions you will get an A no doubt.
                
                   tricky test questions and definitely put me to sleep during class.
                
                   I read all of the material in the book, and took notes of the scattered lectures. Still couldn't figure out where she got her test questions from.
                
                   This prof is not that hard as long as you read the book! Her tests come right from the book and lecture...so go to class and you'll be fine!
                
                   Wolf is very unhelful.She talks very fast in her lecture and they are very scattered. plus her tests are IMPOSSIBLE.I made an A in her class b/c I memorized the book.we had a 8 point curve at the end b/c of bad test averages.average was about 60%
                
                   Ok, this was one of THE hardest classes I have had here at A&M. She's tough.
                
                   She was a cool teacher, very informative. She gets really pissed when you walk out in the middle of class. Fun atmosphere, interesting subjects. Great sense of humor.
