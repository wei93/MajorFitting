 it do not take it do not take it
 i gained a lot more respect for
 activities were fun and tests were not
 if you do the extra credit
 reading required for this class
 bad i highly recommend her
 this class the lectures are
 too much reading
 dr jones is
 and is always there to help
 to study vocal and pay attention to details on
 the end of semester project be ready to work
 point to receive a b in this class all
 questions right also the lecture quizzes are the same
 slow down at all no technology is allowed at
 but they are very predictable and easy as long
 it resonates throughout her lectures the only thing that
 managed to get a b great professor and so
 was disorganized boring and i was expecting something different
 about important people and youll do fine on the
 test she gives an extra credit opportunity at the
 if you read the text enormous amount of reading
 this class unless you really have to hard subject
 were often worded strangely and confused many students there
 writing but if youre interested in it it isnt
 tests and you should be fine his lectures are
 most exciting person in the world so lectures can
 either for tests you need to go to class
 dog one day hes really easily accessible and nice
 material on them but he gives an option for
 are pretty easy and she is such a nice
 and then said something very different later in lecture
 about your grade the only gripe is the lack
 outline of notes that are the exact same topics
 get interested in the material compared to the anth205
 you wont regret going definitely take de ruiter made
 for that grade still dr gursky is not helpful
 learned nothing about she does ask questions about the
 youll be good great professor and he really knows
 to teach but what he told us to study
 though because he puts his notes up online make
 the studying in you should be fine i really
 through all of the information needed for the test
 100 very easy class she is very peppy which
 great although sometimes class would get a bit boring
 helpful at all her tests are hard and there
 are identical to lecture slides which are posted online
 she doesnt put up her powerpoints online anymore go
 you to do your best without her help but
 review sessions help a lot no comments no comments
