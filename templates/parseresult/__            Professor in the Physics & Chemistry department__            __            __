 take this class somewhere else
 help but there are clicker questions the quizzes worksheets
 help sessions and is extremely helpful however her lectures
 writing on the whiteboard for classes of 200 to
 minute to start this is a hard course in
 can view them any time she gives a ridiculous
 no grasp of physics takes course evaluation too seriously
 phys is going to be hard regardless she regularly
 the final if you do better and the final
 sessions and again read the book helps a lot
 too seriously doesnt actually teach i learned very little
 are hard do yourself and a favor and take
 killer curve coursewide is big homework was not reasonable
 to succeed not a good teacher all class materials
 help sessions i found she was the most helpful
 helpful at all and very confusing even though she
 willing to help but only if you put forth
 class materials and lecture notes posted online before the
 you a is also extremely beneficial dont tell her
 a review on mastering and she will post two
 though she is intimidating go to her office hours
 already know everything before coming to class going to
 that you care about her class she will help
 somewhere else dr ene offers tons of help sessions
 hours especially to go over your tests this is
 material youre left to learn the material completely on
 in this class and i like physics she expects
 your share of effort lectures are confusing if youre
 i was making below class average on the tests
 a ridiculous amount of online homework so do not
 her lectures are confusing long and often not finished
 to tutoring and reading the book however you have
 the tests but she replaces your lowest test average
 class but they are all online so you can
 to go to for building a relationship with her
 most helpful out of all the professors ive had
 prepared or play catch up all semester ene is
 though dr ene was intimidating but after many questions
 but do all the homework and study and you
 hard to understand and is not good at teaching
 ive had the common exams were hard but she
 especially to go over your tests this
 very nice woman but she is hard
 average with the final if you do
 and already know everything before coming to
 tiny scattered writing on the whiteboard for
 to see take this class somewhere else
 is killer curve coursewide is big homework
 hard class in general but i struggled
 as a teacher if you show that
