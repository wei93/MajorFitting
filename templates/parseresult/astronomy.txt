 time youll need to spend studying to get an
 i got by with just listening to the lectures
 time making sure you know the homework and you
 passionate about astronomy and he makes jokes throughout lectures
 take again loved the teacher and the material was
 every tuesday at 500 but some parts of it

 an intro class take another professor at all costs
