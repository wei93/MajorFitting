 in a way that makes it easy to
 there is a lot of reading but
 anything new she is very
 has a true desire to
 with him in my opinion
 hes grading is very detailed
 from the book she doesnt
 and he expects college level writing from his students
 all and never uses stuff he says in class
 pass the test he is clear on what he
 him again in a heart beat mr levchak designs
 do not take horrible teacher took onlinelots of reading
 of the questions are based on opinion and not
 again she is an awesome teacher her classes are
 good at explaining things more than once i will
 straight forward he gives great reviews and if you
 which helps clarify he is always willing to answer
 take him mr alonzos discussion questions are very interesting
 to think she was teaching a grad level class
 scan through the readings because it is on the
 no background in crim and her assignments are wackadoodle
