 her for extra help during office hours i highly
 of colloquialisms that most classes never cover he has

 total each 33 of your overall grade he does
 looking to actually learn and further their spanish skills
 midterm and final but there was also online homework
 her students she explains everything clearly and welcomes questions
 interesting there are no powerpoint slides but long lectures
 i highly recommend her and when i say the

 passionate about the subject you will learn a lot
 you in any way he can professor arizpe is
 no clue why so many people fail his tests
 though very few points he truly makes you think

 the majority of class youll do fine he is
