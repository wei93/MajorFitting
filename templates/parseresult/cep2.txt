 if you read and study lecture notes i enjoyed
 will happily be taking her again she comes off
 students to be proud of theirs she loves when
 it sounds pay attention in class and take notes
 amazing instructor his grading style is extremely laid back
 really breaks things down into practical terms case studies
 utsa the test were very book intensive i felt
 work with you on missed exams he expects lots
 hidden agendas simply do the assignments on time if
 class but i learned more from him that any
 get her run she lacks the ability to teach
 is open for discussion in lectures this professor was
 loved his class extremely well informed and organized an
 in family play therapy it is her specialty she
 list her as a choice but if you get
 success she provides positive feedback does not let anyone
 he enjoys his job dr hinojosa works really hard
 awesome tamara is a bit full of her self
 teachers like dr hinojosa who challenge and inspire their
 easy the final is a comprehensive take home exam
 respect from her students when she offers none she
 for more questions and answers very knowledge and empathic
 as a learning resource first time a professor used
 her students and works hard to empower them shes
 lets you know what a great job you are
 the book word for word so def read read
 it was a pleasure to be in her class

 she prides her self on her education as a
 take her class she is a caring professor that
 your money she is a complete airhead poorinstruction used
 world advise on being a therapist and graded fair
 for 34 hours she is the one dont waist
 flies by absolutely the best teacher in the counseling
 a wonderful professor she is really helpful and very
 an a be ready to work hard for it
 wolf in sheeps clothing she grades hard expects high
 hard but you will learn dr fleming is an
 with stories and examples that 2 hours flies by
 well with explaining your deficiency and gets you back
 work and participation only opened up the discussion for
 and is stuck up for it if you want
 would be near impossible to fail this class but
 their goals and dreams she is culturally sensitive highly
 career very interesting but i thought was creative we
 experience within the field and taught prior at utsa
 and understand things great teacher she is a good
 so knowledgeable about the subject matter and he tries
 skip a slide but truly i believe he enjoys
