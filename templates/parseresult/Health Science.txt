 rarely taught the class instead she put us in
 ask her about your grades she acts careless about
 tardiness or cellphones if you dont get at least
 half the time he grades papers very toughly his
 him you wont regret it he is not very

 does most students are uncomfortable the first few days
 he is the nicest professor i have had to
 hint at the answers during the lecture his test
 he genuinely cares about each and every student unlike
 then told us after everyone had taken it that
 grade if you do all the work group projects
