 dr dempsey is a
 he can be a bit boring
 and tells everyone it looks like a template when
 at all cost knows what hes doing but doesnt
 not answer your questions return any emails or treat
 work youll get an a help out the radio
 not a journalism or rtv major we rarely used
 for asking do not take any class with him
 quizzes are timed usually 5 to 10 minutes so
 of my college career with this instructor he talks
 save yourself a headache he is the worst teacher
 learn a lot from him if you care quizzes
 review of what will be on his tests hella
 lectures wonderful and thoughtful professor this professor will help
 and tests are simple as long as you study
 do more teaching wise thats the man dr dempsey
 a regular bad ass and he has great knowledge
 this class but he will always give great constructive
 time youll need book if you need a credit
 the material from the book its impossible to get
 wanted left many of the students confused and just
 career i actually love showing up for his lectures
 by texas am universitycommerce but i guess it is
 and with no warning if you ask for clarification
 constantly check his outline there are weekly quizzes sometimes
 questions he is clear about assignments and is one
 game highlights or simulated playbyplays two tests which hell
 likely the worst professor in the history of the
 he will even take it he leaves topics open
 material and teaches it well he explains things thoroughly
 laziest and will avoid answering questions then send you
 uses a text book even though he has always
 on anything i had a horrible experience in his
 or help with an assignment he makes you feel
 and take notes really easy teachervery annoying thoughhe studders
 dont check the outline and syllabus regularly youre gonna
 the answer rather than answer it himself if you
 getting it grading is lenient pretty much gives the
 a non film major this will definitely help your
 of topic highly recommended thsi guy knwos his stuff
 study for would definitely take again if i could
 are a human being i do not understand why
 did a very poor job explaining what he wanted
 but he gives you the answers if you pay
 to endure this torture honestly his course outline sucks
 need them quiz every class thats like three questions
 youre gonna have a bad time his quizzes are
 gives outstanding feedback on how to improve work very
 clear answer from him unless youre a broadcast journalism
 a good chance you cant avoid taking his classes
