                   He is so nice and makes it pretty easy to make an A. However, to learn the course material long term, you will have to do some extra work.

                   I found this professor to be one of the best I have experienced while at A&M. She was very witty and intelligent, and truly cared whether the students had retained any of the complex information. She was a wonderful human being. I never saw the side of her conveyed down in the &quot;Bad&quot; rating.
                
                   After taking this class I changed my minor to linguistics. Everts is an terrific prof with a lot of experience in her field. She's also really funny and sarcastic. The class tends to become disorganized, but she is always helpful and genuinely interested in the students. I still see her around, and many of my classmates to by her office to visit.
                
                   One of the worst profs I've ever had. She takes all of her own personal stresses out on all of her students and will not spend quality time helping you. During her office hours she will treat you an interuption. She should not be working with students. Not very helpful at all and is angry when you don't understand her right away. Bad class!
