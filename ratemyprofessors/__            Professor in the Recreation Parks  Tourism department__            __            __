Professor is slow to respond to emails though. If you have a question you need to email him 2 days before an assignment is due or he won't respond in time. Very picky grader. 
                
                   Mr. Fox is a great teacher. He takes attendance. His tests are easy, if you read and pay attention to lectures you will do fine. He is easy to talk to and is understanding. There is a major group project in this class.
                
                   Professor Durko is so nice and easy to approach with questions.  She tells you up front on day one that she doesn't do last minute extra credit, and if you work hard, you will do well in her class.  She did give us an opportunity for some small extra credit, she was very fair.  I enjoyed her class!  Study hard for tests, there is a ton of info!
                
                   made an 88 and when I asked for extra credit she basically laughed in my face (through e-mail) and told me I was unprofessional. you get the grade you earn peeps and according to her that means without any teacher help. lol what a joke. Very rude e-mail written at the end of the course. She was nice at the beginning.
                
                   Professor Durko is Awesome! Loves getting engaged during class and getting to know her students! Definitely one of my more fun classes I have ever taken and it was because of her that it was so fun! Highly recommend!
