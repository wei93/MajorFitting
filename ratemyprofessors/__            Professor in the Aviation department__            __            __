                   Really enjoyed his aviation classes. Sometimes it can be a little dry and boring and he definitely loves the random details, but overall is very supportive and wants to open your eyes to all things aviation. Sometimes I think he's a little behind the times in terms of airlines & technology, but that's nothing against him. I love his jokes and humor
