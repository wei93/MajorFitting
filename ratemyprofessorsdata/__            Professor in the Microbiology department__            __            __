One thing I absolutely hate is there are 3 projects with your group and then you take a test with them... I enjoyed doing all the work myself and taking the test myself for them to receive great credit. I would not take him again do to this.
                
                   His tests are HARD. Know the material and the little details, go to class, and get together with the smart people to collaborate. Your best bet is to be there for every attendance quiz, which counts as a test grade in the end.   The final is optional. Don't take it. Seriously. It's bad.
                
                   Interesting material, but at first you'll think he's there just to talk about his work experience, which was pretty annoying but you get numbed to it. Wasn't a hard grader, just a matter of paying attention + review sessions. Pop quizzes are just for attendance. Tests are 60% free response but is clear on what he wants. Only curves if avg is 75
                
                   Great!
