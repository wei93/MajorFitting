                   Great Prof! Really loves teaching and has a lot of interesting stories from his past experiences. Very energetic and passionate about tourism. Always willing to help, wants everyone to pass class which isnt hard to do anyway but you should come cuz he does take attendance.
                
                   One of the best Prof's. you'll ever have, hands down!!!  Very  helpful, and cares about his students.  Makes boring material very interesting.
                
                   Awesome prof! Lots of energy and easy to follow. Teaches out of the book with exams that are not tricky at all. All you need to do is go to class!
