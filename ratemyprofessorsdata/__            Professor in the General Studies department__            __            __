There aren't that many test and plenty of extra credit. Sometimes assigns homework but not often and it can be done very fast. This class can help you with other college classes.
                
                   Awesome prof! She's amazing and really cares about getting to know her students, occasionally gives homework but it's never hard and she loves to talk about movies at the beginning of class!
