                   Awesome professor. Take him he teaches you great techniques for speaking. He'll give you an A as long as you are professional about what you talk about and do not take his class as a joke. Even though it was not hard at all.
                
                   wonderful guy! He really makes the class interesting. so long as you go to class, speak up every now and then, and give okay speeches you will do fine. His goal is to make you think, and it does that in a way that is interesting. I would totally recommend him!
                
                   Great teacher, just show up to class and do well on the speeches. Pretty easy to get an A. Make sure you volunteer and that your speeches make time.
                
                   Professor Lang is a great teacher and a little cutie. I loved going to each class. He really knows what he is talking about. Speak up in his class, he really likes it. Thanks to him I now am not afraid of public speaking. :)
                
                   Professor Lang is incredibly intelligent, witty, and humorous- you'll never have a dull moment in his class!  He loves creativity, boldness, and unexpected/surprising speeches from his students.
                
                   She was the prof for the Recitation part of Ethics. She was really easy you just have to go to class becuase attendence is a grade. She has a lot of projects but there pretty easy.
