Everything that was graded was returned late. I didn't even know how I was doing before the drop date. I turned in a final draft without having ANY feedback on the original. Avoid this teacher if you can.
                
                   This guy is a piece of work. 7 essay question exams in 1.5 hours ... with quotes and examples from the multiple texts that he provides for each chapter. There is no traditional textbook in this class; in fact, there is nothing at all traditional about this class. Also, be prepared to write a LOT. My recommendation: avoid like the plague.
                
                   This professor is ridiculous. He give A TON of reading and expects you to understand all of it and write over it. The class has nothing to do with Media & Crime. If you LOVE to read and write then take him bc thats ALL you are going to be doing.
                
                   Mass Media and Corrections. Not good at giving feedback at all, and when he says he will get an assignment back to you by a certain date, expect it 3 weeks lat. He demands A LOT of reading, too much actually and none of the readings are very interesting or understandable. I really don't think the assignments and classwork relate to class very well.
                
                   Thought provoking.  Interesting.  Innovative.  Encouraging.  Definitely one of the most difficult, but best professors I have ever had.  Exams are really challenging.  If you are a good student, you will love Doc Brad, if you are not, do not even try!
                
                   Really tough, but you will learn lots.  Be ready to work and you will do okay.  Assignments not too bad, but tests really hard.  Makes you think.
