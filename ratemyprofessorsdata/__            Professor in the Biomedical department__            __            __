                   one of the EASIEST classes on campus! just show up and take the online quizzes and it's an easy A!  no exams, just best 10 out of 14 quizzes. each week is a different person giving a lecture over their field. an easy class that had interesting lectures, but if you do skip or miss class ALL lectures are uploaded online to ecampus.

                   Dr. Omran wants everyone in his class to succeed and make a good grade, so his tests are not difficult and he gives extra credit. He puts his lectures online, so you don't  even have to go to class. He is a little hard to understand though because of his accent, but I would definitely recommend him to anyone that needs this class!
