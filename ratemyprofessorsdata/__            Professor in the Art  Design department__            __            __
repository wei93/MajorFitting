Don't miss class, don't turn stuff in late, and the more effort you put into something, the better. Pro tip: he loves abstract/non-objective stuff. I'd take his class again if I had to, I learned a lot and made great art.
                
                   Phil has a tough time deciding what he wants out of a project and sticking to it. You can't do much about how he acts/grades, but here are things that will help your final grade... 1. Show up every day unless you're dying, and then bring a doctor's note. 2. Do the sketchbook exercises as soon as they are assigned. 3. Participate in critique.
                
                   He's a good guy, definitely one of the better VIST profs. He will help you out if you need clarificationtechnique help, and is pretty understanding if you have an emergency. He's scrupulous when it comes to "craft", but he's a fair grader and definitely tries to be systematic about evaluation and instruction. The workload was very decent. 
                
                   I loved this class
                
                   She's great and inspirational. I like her as a person and as an artist, but sometimes she is unclear, but lets be real. Artistically minded people are hardly ever crystal clear, and sometimes the ambiguity lead us to more boundless projects, although it was difficult to overcome. She is a tough grader,make sure you FOLLOW DIRECTIONS! CRAFTSMANSHIP!
