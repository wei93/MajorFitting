                   Awesome man who cares for his students inside the classroom, but more importantly outside the classroom in their lives.  An incredibly inspirational and motivational professor, speaker, and leader.
                
                   He is very unclear about what he wants in the class. In my class he spoke in circles about the same topic for the entire 6 week course. You will never know exactly what he is grading you on because he is not clear. He is &quot;flexible&quot; and will tell you himself for days, but when it comes down to it, he is not a professor you want to take.
