                   he was unclear on assignments, unorganized, and seemed to get his feelings hurt.  his tests are easy, and i would have love the class if he had taught it rather than trying to dole out group work.
                
                   Not only is this an easy class, but Joe really goes into great detail about things.  I have learned more from his class than any other class I have ever been in.  The best teacher I have ever had.
