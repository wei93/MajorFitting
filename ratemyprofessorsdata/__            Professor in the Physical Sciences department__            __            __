                   He gives clicker question everyday, just to check attendance. His lectures taught me nothing, but I read over all the examples throughout the chapter (not at the end). Weekly homework in varying length- buy Chegg for it! He also makes coming to 2 office hours part of the grade, and he's helpful there. Tests are similar to the old ones posted.
                
                   Very hard class
                
                   The lectures are kinda boring, but if you go and answer the clicker questions, she'll give you 5 bonus points. Her class is kinda difficult because your grade relies on 4 tests. But the final is noncumulative. She was really nice and definitely knows what she's teaching and can answer questions pretty well. And she'll tell you if she doesn't know. 
                
                   Pick another oceanography prof. This class is strictly memorization but it takes up so much time because of all the information given. I've heard multiple people say that other professors are way easier on them. Slides are posted online which is nice but they are disorganized and filled with trivia information.  
                
                   Lectures were pretty boring and tough to sit through. reads off slides. but never read text book and still made high Bs and As on test. 3 tests and a non-cumulative final. gives extra credit for coming to class and answering iclicker ?s. adds 5 points to final grade. attendance not mandatory. not super easy but manageable if you study.
