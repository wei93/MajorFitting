                   Not a class you can breeze through, especially in the summer.  You have to actually make an effort.  Taking up air doesn't get you an A in this class.  Had a good time and enjoyed the interesting music.
                
                   had for Drawing I. You do have to make an effort, and he'll definitely be honest about what he thinks of your drawing. a little bit of a perfectionist, but all because he wants to see you improve. really good teacher, awesome at drawing. funny too. liked the class a lot. pretty much only gives out A's or B's.
                
                   Highly recommend. Had him for Drawing 1. Expects you to actually try, and marks down for tardiness (which really sucks if you have a 9am class). If you get there on time and give it an effort, you'll get an A. I learned so much and could see myself improve. Expect to put a lot of time into this class, but you get a lot out. Really good teacher.
                
                   GD1 wasn't easy, but a great class. Four big projects, with some assignments in between. Lots of critique sessions. Don't bother buying the textbookpacket. Sketchbook use required. Anatol seems scary at first, but  has a heart of gold and wants to help you succeed. VERY knowledgeable about the GD business.  Take this class with him  if you can!
                
                   Favorite Teacher! so great
                
                   Great Teacher! Favorite one of the semester! He is helpful and knows the material and programs very well. Sometimes, however it is hard to get the assignments and what exactly is expected. If you want an A prepare yourself to work for it!
