                   Cons: -Unclear in class -Lecture style is very fast-paced -Homework solutions given a only a few days before the exam -Unintentionally condescending by saying the following in class: every single problem in class is easy, if you're doing bad you're not working as hard as the students who are doing well  Pros: -Funny -Nice/Friendly 
                
                   Good professor, just make sure that you don't sleep through the 8AM lecture. Attendance isn't required, but he grades you at the end to see if you have all the notes.  If you feel like you don't understand what he is asking you to do for a project, don't be afraid to ask him, he's one of the nicest professors I've ever had.
