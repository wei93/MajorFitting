                   He's extremely friendly and wants you to learn the subject material. However, I find that this class is excessive and lab takes up 90% of the time but only counts for 1/4 of the over all grade. Lecture tests are pretty difficult mainly because its hard to complete 42  questions in 50 minutes. This class is doable if you study ALL the time.
                
                   This class is A LOT to keep up with. The lecture isn't as bad, but lab is tons of homework, papers and write ups on top of labs and data sheets. Very time consuming and not easy work. I had to drop because I was in too many hours and couldn't keep up. I suggest taking this class when you can devote a ton of, if not all of your time to it.
