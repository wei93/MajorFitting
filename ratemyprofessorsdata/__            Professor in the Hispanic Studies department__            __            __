                   Professor Montejo is now at the University of Arkansas, and I loved her class! Her expectations were very clear, and she was always there to help. She's really funny and makes class interesting. I would definitely recommend her class! It's not an easy A, but definitely worth taking.
                
                   Such a nice lady and always there to help. Not hard to make an A  if you go to class. She gave students flexibility in choosing presentation topics and is willing to work with you if you have conflicts. Would definitely recommend her.

                   She is a light in the middle of the darkness that is college. She is not always clear in her meaning of words and tends to have unnecessary information in her lectures but she cares about your grade and will help you in always possible! She is also a big fan of projects to help you grade instead of taking quizzes she'll have you do a presentation.
