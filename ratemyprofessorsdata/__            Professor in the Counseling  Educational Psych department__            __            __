I could have gotten an A in her class but because i missed the last assignment because i had a car accident she gave me a B when i had an 89.8.  that's how bad it is with her. didnt matter I had 96 on both of her tests. Don't take her.
                
                   Dr. Vasquez is without a doubt the worst professor I have ever had, ad I will be graduating with my Masters in the Spring of 2015. She cannot take criticism and will not tolerate being challenged. She will not teach you anything and thus, you will not learn anything in her class. You could not pay me to take another course with her.
