                   Easy A. This is not what I expected out of an intro photography class. Assignments were "cheesy" and far too simple for anyone coming into this class with any prior experience in photography. Gave little to no instruction of how to use current editing software (Lightroom), which is essential to know for upper level classes. Did not learn anything.
                
                   As long as you show up every class and participate, and have work to show, this is one of the easiest classes out there. She encourages questions and really tries to help while letting you be creative. I learned a lot from her class and the assignments she chose. Follows her syllabus grading outline, completely fair. Great instructor.
                
                   DON'T TAKE ANY CLASS WITH HER, SHE WILL DECREASE YOUR "GPA"
