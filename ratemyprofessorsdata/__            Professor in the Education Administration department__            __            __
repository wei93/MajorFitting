                   Wasn't sure what to expect, but the class was really interesting and challenging. Lots of reading!!! (but it was all really interesting stuff). Unfortunately, some of the students just complained the whole time and because they were too lazy to do the work. If you can, avoid taking ANY classes with SAAHE students!!! They are the worse!!!
                
                   Great professor! It's a hard class  but he did a good job of making a sort of boring topic interesting. He's also really smart and not bad to look at either! ;)
                
                   This can be an intimidating topic for beginners to IT. However, Trez makes it very interesting by incorporating a fantasy theme into weekly assignments. Your grade is determined by your overall earned XP each week. Assignments are optional but of course not doing them would only damage your grade. He provides plenty of in-person hours for help.
                
                   Trez is the most enthusiastic professor I've had so far at Texas A&M. Being the director of the Technology Management degree program, he clearly knows what he is talking about. He will explain something in however many ways it takes for you to understand how to do it. Also hilariously entertaining and makes even an 8AM class very fun.
