 moron she is a wonderful teacher it is up
 fine she told it like it was fair essays
 it believe me no comments great thought i would
 times but you could still easily pass the class
 and i learned a lot no surprises and makes
 three hours and did nothing but lecture she did
 she even does extra credit if you cant follow
 and did my work she was clear and helpfulwe
 students first and outlines all expectations very fair i
 enjoy this coursenot so much didnt really get anything
 her in a heartbeat easy class all you have
 kinda like taking a class with charley browns parents
 a while to show you are paying attention she
 the work for the semister is spread out nicely
 what she was lecturing about because she bounced back
 a good time i got an a and did
 great teacher passionate and enthusiastic simple class attendance homework
 extra credit learned stuff that i never learned before
 boring repeats the same boring info that is not
 everyone else this teacher is very boring and always
 thats about the only good thing i can say
 work yeah she lectures alot but that why its
 her favorites and she made no attempt to hide
 i would say take this class it was fun
 course id take a class again with her in
 great use of the textbook she showed a movie
 you know what is expected she also gives many
 a class is extremely easy her lectures do get
 class she was clear and all expectations are outlined
 the most important part of taking this class easy
 go this isnt 1950 i agree with everyone else
 with another person and it was terrible she was
 worth while easy a she sat at the front
 us class projects group projects used the book in
 but nothing worth while ever comes out blah blah
 have to do is the homework and the writings
 tina turner move over she was great cooked for
 i took this class beofre dropped she was outstanding
 i enjoyed her come on she reviews the test
 participation a great teacher wants you to actively participate
 in a limited way but it was fine she
 i liked about her the most is overall she
 as a group and that was fun ok i
 skip class do all the homework and say something
 ok i know why there are some negative comments
 enjoy this coursenot so much didnt really get
 a fair grader thats about the only good
 was fair essays papers spells it all out
 she was great cooked for us class projects
