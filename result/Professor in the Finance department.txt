 dr loving is a great teacher

 what you need to learn
 learned a lot and was
 you understand the elements of this class but it
 are good guy wants to get to know his
 read the book before the lecture ask a lot
 and has a strong accent i was annoyed because
 one of a kind professor he is very passionate
 you are on your own in terms of teaching
 exam questions at first i thought this guy was
 profs guidance did not match expectations he should provide
 not a math based class class live sessions were
 winne the pooh i would take him again he
 no comprehension that us the students have no background
 must work to stay up or youll get left
 homeworks and tried hard you would get a quotcquot
 this is very cruel please act like a normal
 practice quizzes do not help to prepare must read
 so that you are aware of what is going
 tough class i took her in the summer where
 instructor and very helpful excellent instructor i enjoyed his
 quiz are not covered in the reading you have
 get a decent grade anyone who has a good
 chapter helped with the test there is no textbook
 grade great instructor very thorough and helpful awesome professor
 she let me make it up i love her
 email which was a huge plus during an accelerated
 the exams are not bad had one quiz befor
 his own scheduled lectures and was difficult to get
 her a good teacher she gives quizzes before explaining
 give test results promptly this was a math class
 he goes by what the syllabus says not what
 taken there are no lectures and the only requirements
 test to pass the class and transfer credits worst
 class online very difficult class but got through it
 with a baii emulator so he shows you exactly
 her in class groups lots of extra credit opportunities
 the type of material or questions on the test
 attend classlive sessions and listen to lectures repeatedly he
