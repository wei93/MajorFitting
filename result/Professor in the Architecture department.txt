 professor segner is a great
 but it took a lot of work to do
 did not like dr vanegas class it is all
 hardly ever went to class because i couldnt stand
 couldnt stand to listen to him talk mainly about
 think this is an easy a class i got
 and youll be good to go
 feel excited about the work and gives great advice
 grades off of creativity and innovation which is something
 she truly cares for the students extremely helpful
 wow him to get an
 he definitely knows what he is talking about
 a professor like rodney hill he
 not take this class
 is a good man he
 like a mom really cares about how well you
 its just average this class is pretty easy no
 passionate about construction and loves his students he definitely
 professor at am she is so knowledgeable about her
 novel feeling of wishing the class wasnt ending if
 solid study session in before the test and youll
 is she rusty she shows favoritism for students that
 wonderful insights and inspiring i highly recommend her classes
 memorize reviews are nothing like the test extremely boring
 memorization but its easy if you come to class
 brought my laptop type 100 wpm and still couldnt
 brit accent and speak too fast avoid if your
 meaningless breakdowns there is no comparison to how boring
 refreshing to have every once in a while this
 get ready to know the pps inside and out
 to go and she talks fast but i learned
 tests are 90 to 120 questions and he gives
 the industry and his classes omg hardest professor ive
 this course especially since i put the minimum effort
 few notes changes home work requirements all the time
 abstract stuff i dont recommend her to anyone besides
 would expect but very doable if you want an
 the smartest of students in class i didnt even
 never gives you all the information you need but
 but certainly others have i think the average grade
 like her her guidelines change and she can screw
 you would even if ends isnt your major your
 listen and have any common sense about you dr
 is terrible you have to go in there knowing
 to do is pay attention in class and follow
 poor experience with her because she teaches first year
 long and pointless all of the work you do
 be taken with the lecture notes at any point
 the better off you will be dr ali was
 take good notes on her powerpoints and youll do
