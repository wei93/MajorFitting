 geology
 her tests are based on critical thinking
 dr yancey is fun to have
 online and he even
 go to his office hours he
 random attendance quizzes
 to class because he does
 i had to q drop
 all of the power points
 her lectures are long and boring
 few but that made the tests harder to prepare
 remember you must rack up points using the online
 i never got any while some people did she
 her her work sucks she is very difficult you
 talk about it to this day highly recommend she
 had a 795 in the class bad i obtained
 advice to you is to take dr schultz this
 power points and i didnt bother buying a textbook
 and i was able to get as with substantial
 have friends who have taken her get their tests
 the 40s for everyone i do not recommend taking
 speak softly he is very helpful and even lets
 have any trouble just go in and ask her
 you are used too her class is critical thinking
 end of the semester she goes by too fast
 first glance do not take his class change your
 a funny sense of humor dr reid is very
 are all write out compared to multiple choice in
 organized at all in fact she forgot we had
 tests so you kind of just have to guess
 know someone who got 50 extra credit points so
 guides which are very helpful pay att to powerpoints
 intelligent man in his field he tends to talk
 i would not recommend it especially if your academic
 or better ive had dr cepeda for almost all
 hard as hell almost everyone gets a b he
 what he has pertaining to the equipment the school
 of the book attendance isnt mandatory and his exams
 and pictures on a flash drive at the beginning
 explain things pretty well his exams were pretty easy
 should i enjoyed taking her class there are online
 quizzes exam reviews enjoyed his assignments because they were
 many resources to draw upon he was a great
 72 80 and 50 on her tests the lab
 dr m is you are reading this than thank
 his tests are multiple choice yet tricky average class
 her slides do not match up with her lectures
 and he curves your final grade no comments no
 reflect your grade she is a nazi when it
 quizzes you will pass every exam know the material
