 dr fulmore is a great professor he
 professor more should be like him
 with the material i learned a lot from this
 technique communicates and uses tech well this class started
 extremely lenient on her gradinglate work the best teacher
 complete the group projects and he is absolutely no
 was having the assignments due before 8am monday morning
 up for class great teacher important to pay attention
 for a number of classes and it is always
 you large lecture mrs west is a wonderful professor
 make him difficult to understand at times but he
 took it big mistake there are no notes online
 entire semester worth of work instructor was terrible syllabus
 clear directions on how to complete the biggest assignments
 took his class face to face i really liked
 all his powerpoint notes online love his accent made
 learning experience she takes learning to a personal level
 take her class dr nair is a sweet lady
 interesting and fun the class is super easy but
 him love dr swartz hes very easy just make
 the exams are incredibly detailed and very difficult if
 you and his office door is always open for
 his class and he is always available for help
 would not recommend this class the material he prepared
 they are short and easy to write and as
 to know her early on and showing effort in
 skipping subjects because he thought they would be too
 on the syllabus negative unorganized changes the rules grades
 she is willing to help you with any problem
 students take advantage of that i assure you it
 not to make an a unless you tried i
 a class on communication disorders and has a comm
 really embarrassing when other professors would have to stop
 for the papers she doesnt believe in exams whoo
 your consious will have a little scottish accent too
 only professor that i feel i have really learned
 in the morning which is when i had this
 your exams knowing nothing gives out random notebook quizzes
 i liked the class though excellent professorvery knowledgeable keeps
 of all enjoy his scottish accent he is easily
 is imperative she is always willing to help us
 be less than excited to answer questions or look
 lecture but other than that she is great amazingly
 disturbingly so this guy spent a lot of time
 and cry he is a softie the only reason
 a lot about the history of the bible without
 a b at the time because it was so
 too confusing this included the erie doctrine the problem
 board quizzes are at the beginning of class so
 very helpful and easy to talk to no comments
