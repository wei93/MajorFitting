 dr fehr
 she also gives tons of extra credit
 gives out reviews before tests
 points at the end dr sandlin is by far
 i would take her again rahn is a great
 one group project and a written test as well
 week which was a journal or a few short
 lots of questions come directly from the textbook there
 2 points off your grade 2 tests 100 q
 shows up late to class every time and her
 not need to put up with her i enjoyed
 and misses class quite a bit overall the material
 i could tell she did not want to teach
 she is great and you should take her take
 enjoyed attending her class she helped me understand how
 she made the class very interesting and fun she
 i had him for health 210 this semester he
 so you learn in class and really dont have
 i didnt get to see my grades at all
 made a 100 on every thing if you just
 she was my zumba instructor and i loved her
 due every week and you only have 6 minutes
 you have to go to class never used my
 class over winter break and loved it it was
 every time i asked her a question regarding technique
 in the syllabus or how assignments are weighted 4
 enjoyed this class and wish i could take more
 the questions on the exam wouldnt take again first
 can she is awesome tests are easy attendance mandatory
 actually tell you what assignments he wants 2 does
 be sure to write down the questions after you
 nice has to be one of the easier classes
 to me should be an easy a if you
 a on her test take her if you can
 that she really loves to dance which is refreshing
 when we do group anatomy projects there were 2
 near future she is strict on attendance but does
 usually inclass group work graded on participation gives hints
 prof who really cares about her students and what
 loves what she teaches about and is really great
 test so you must read questions are tricky i
 the class the only bummers were that attendance was
 also will give easy bonus points if youre in
 you dont read overall a pretty cool guy though
 test are completely participation grade not how well you
 is unhelpful and rude never really had a clear
 she gives extra credit and the tests are not
 if its your major if not then online take
 as well as weekly journal entries that are very
 hadnt taught me so well how to dance id
 has to be the best professor i have ever
 to class because she gets everyone so pumped up
 had wylie for two different classessafety221 and healthy lifestyles231
 how many people died bc of blah blah w
 intermediate course in the fall i took his class
 for kine 199 i took beginner tumbling with him
 she will help you and work with you through
 and the future of the field no comments really
 class if you dont get an athats pretty sad
 her because i was afraid of failing the course
 class as long as you attend class and dont
 him no comments this is the only professor that
 class pay attention do the reading study etc but
 required i strongly recommend anyone who can to take
 are weekly online quizzes but if you keep up
 teacher twice i found discrepancies in the grade book
 and helpful tried to keep class interesting easily approachable
 he takes roll everyday grumpy prof who can goof
 of rankings not a good professor nothing in class
 can meet for lunch i will definitely keep in
 really easy but she makes the tests way harder
 people found the class difficult i did not as
 and be funny a lot of the time never
 class was a breeze and i actually looked forward
 tests are asking you for specific statistics not focusing
 details in the graphs he gives you no textbook
 cool lady who clearly knows what shes doing im
 in the class for missing 3 days on accident
 was always ready to help you with more difficult
 in sc campus in texas and had no luck
 no book necessary uses power point handouts which he
 advantage of her very good teacher i was glad
 make fun of you in front of the class
 overall good though i would recommend taking her class
 the curriculum to blame though shes a cool professor
 email her if youre confused tests arent too bad
 and i learned a great deal fun awesome swimming
 he is seriously an amazing man hes so sweet
 gymnasts take this class too awesome professor super passionate
 bigger picturenot kidding there are so many questions that
 werent on the same page sometimes when they taught
 as i did well on the final that i
 120 yoga class absolutely love her there are weekly
 give tests but do not miss your weekly online
 passed the class with an a you can tell
 had the balls to call in sick he was
 was totally ok with it there was not another
 good mix of girls and guys theres around 2
 b go to class so sweet great teacher really
 encouraging words all the time it made me want
