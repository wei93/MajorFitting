 practice exams sometimes with the answers which is really
 texas am hands downs wish he taught bio chem

 question1 point 240 total points 215240a 191240b time limit
 4 got an a i took dr muranos class
 but you must know why the answer is that
 credit for showing up to class and extra iclicker
 answers on it i didnt really listen to lectures
 for a scantron there are 3 test a final
 should have he usually gives a practice exam before
 he was very hard to understand i couldnt follow
 teach she moves very quickly and covers a lot
 get a b in the course he gives practice
 dull just fill in the blank powerpoints didnt need
 to look over old tests lectures take the whole
 turn them on and let them run while i
 one project that is insanely long and detailed do
 4 online tests skim over the textbook and maybe
 last semester a lot more entertaining learning was fun
 dr murano is an incredible professor but you do
 a boring lecturer notes are fillintheblank but the information
 funny you must attend class even if you make
 there are a total of about 100150 study questions
 didnt need the textbook powerpoints were enough gives extra
 come to class for the pop quizzes read thoroughly
 project is a free a as a test grade
 time limit 50 min i studied all material for
 was easy via texags class format 4 tests 60
 and got 4660 then realized practice exam is almost
 that hard i hardly ever ready which i probably
 as long as you review the practice test grade
 bio chem math and all the other boring subjects
 the information is not always in the book so
 maybe listen to the lectures which are super long
 amazing so helpful and genuinely loves his students creasy
 is quizzes that he literally hands to you i
 to study for but final replaces lowest test grade
 iclicker questions tests are difficult and hard to study
 super long and youll do fine took it online
 each test prior to the test he will post
 answer is that answer come to class
 so skipping is not a good idea
 she assigns one project that is insanely
 practice exam that covers everything that will
 to study for but final replaces lowest
 difficult and hard to study for but
 a nice guy and pretty funny you
