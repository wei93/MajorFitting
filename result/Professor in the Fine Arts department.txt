 art
 drawing so the previous post is from an idiot
 can have the whole class to work on projects
 he is a great teacher who is open
 but if you want to get good
 he dose talk a lot but if
 you complete all the assignments
 he is very unprofessional in the way he deals
 off for a b though it was a summer
 hippy ever if you are not a hippy dont
 help you out if you are taking his class
 as you do them and follow the guidelines youll
 he wants you to do well he will do
 might seem a little cold at first but after
 you get to know him he helped make me
 and read the chapters youll make an easy 100
 mediaquot ie get out of my class graphic design
 anyone nice guy no comments awesome professor you have
 not like our work he does just about everything
 it in studio classes hes really laidback and doesnt
 perhaps they werent paying attention i found him helpful
 students hes always there to help when you ask
 great guystupid class wish i could have skipped it
 make you feel like an ant that hes about
 wish i had taken him for beg draw bring
 on what you enjoy rather than what he does
 get him to speak italian or french its hot
 and pass he makes you learn it though no
 the whole semester really to do it so not
 wadley was the best professor that i took my
 gallery sitting class is full lecture you can tell
 because they did not subscribe to his sayso this
 paper or youll lose out on what could be
 your own hell help if you ask for it
 ever listen and pay attention and you will do
 is usually a good think if youre in viz
 that i should have learned long before my junior
 his lectures are repetitive and usually unnecessary i cant
 the lessons are on online modules that youre supposed
 is so worth it he teaches you so much
 likes to micromanage and can get too personal follow
 does is to weed out the lazy students so
 the wheel becuz he cant teach it he blames
 instructors i have ever had although her grading was
 is a sincere dedicated and fair professor i would
 he teaches and preaches please no more stories about
 she is so cold she was always joking around
 the same generic thing over and over cocky makes
 because he has reasons to back it up everyones
 wasnt so boring i would take the 2nd one
