 dr fox
 the textbook once although this subject is what i
 or finding an internship hazwoper class i personally found
 give you bonus points on test he also tells
 program for a long time he genuinely cares about
 you all the information that you need to get
 book tests are fairly easy kind of boring lectures
 nice person to talk to and he is very
 but it was manageable i had him for environmental
 do well and he makes the class interesting his
 exams in total so its super hard why because
 him if you dont want to die of boredom
 this class is so boring she reads word for
 safety good course certainly useful for students going into
 a reasonable amount of time the tests are hard
 know the concepts that would be on the test
 with superficial time consuming classroom activities it is disheartening
 copy helps a ton on homework and exams dr
 he has a great sense of humor just call
 the powerpoints and listen in class and youre good
 are in class all of his assignments are online
 test material he is a really interesting professor he
 second test i only studied the book and got
 fine the only people suffering are the ones who
 is very polite but when it comes to teaching
 if youve taken just one of his classes doesnt
 up in class discussion and you will do fine
 you will be screwed he does give extra credit
 but its not trouble for a college person great
 you arent interested in the subject great teacher just
 to sleep twice but is a really nice lady
 occasion if you want an easy a take envs
 and would take another course with him i really
 intrigued and for me succeeded always attend class he
 the comments on this site in relation to other
 from the challenge of this class and not try
 warning that there is a group project or three
 his son to give the lecture test are long
 have to read the book because his lectures dont
 a straight a student but his tests just confuse
 write a paper in 1402 the lab is even
 all online he cracked silly jokes and you could
 to teach yourself the material or else you will
 teacher just hard to keep my attention i liked
 laid back he is there to help but he
 hard to get any useful information from him i
 what youre learning about dr moretzsohn is a pretty
 of humor his lectures outline the material i loved
 for help very friendly guy who does not belittle
