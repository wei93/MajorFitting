 of mr miyagi taking over 40 and go will
 reviews do not need to buy book but can
 of sem very detailed and ambiguously worded questions also
 class dont take this prof if you actually want
 if you do not need to take this class
 every week but they arent difficult noncomprehensive final only
 for you tests he allows 1 page of cheat
 to learn the material he holds review sessions every

 comments his optional final is cool he also has
 old exams online and they are very helpful for
 the lab is a separate grade from the class

 for probably decades and with science being such an
 he goes crazy in lecture i have no idea
 to his review sessions read the notes and i
 them i ended up with an a in this
 and fun no final in it quizzes every week
 up and taste the ptc this is college genetics
 on vocab for tests need to buy class notes
 complete the two given practice exams do not leave
 tries to make things fun his tests are straight
 but his notes are useful he puts his old
 the whole classevery friggin day thats amazing his material
 the best at lecturing he speaks to the board
 teacher he prints out his powerpoints and hands out
 great professor he gives practice exams and study guides
 personally i thought his lectures were long and boring
 question but thank goodness for partial credit and his
 nice guy but tests are impossible he curves so
 the board when he lectures and throws random formulas
