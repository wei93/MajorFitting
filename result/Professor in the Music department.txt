 in order to pass this class
 best conductor i have ever
 dr gershman
 at all rollins made the class very interesting for
 extra credit she will give good feedback whether you
 she still gave me pointers though she did let
 the examples in the text at all i had
 are high his instructions and notes are crystal clear
 help you giving you hints and such very helpful
 made an a do not fall asleep in class
 non majors because it was far far too involved
 discuss the different genres through history also the tests
 was talking about i enjoyed his class just listen
 but was very fun and also is a gpa
 day sadly i think you can only pass if
 to be memorized if you like jazz you will
 who needs positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement makes you
 reading weekly quizzes with at least 5 chapters having
 my choice for proffesors but hes the only one
 not my first semester with dr kelly has taught
 is an inspiration and encouragement he has the true
 anything excellent teacher hes grading is pretty hard though
 lectures were extremely boring and unless you are interested
 is a good idea to show up every day
 funny its a quick five weeks so be in
 rollins it was one of my hardest classes he
 really teach you anything in class but if you
 attention an a is easy his first semester at
 take another class from him online class is horrible
 just sucks he is really nice and he has

 need the book which accounts for 23 of his
 lectures he is very laid back super funny there
 subject but rollins got a lot of people excited
 every class but i havent been going and she
 hard at all hes very passionate he talked pretty
 ask for more clarity on something he spends more
