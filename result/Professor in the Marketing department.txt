 marketing
 emails and when he does respond he answers only
 and money with this professor very frustrating class lots
 short notice the professors delivery of the information was
 deal with and hard to communicate with her class
 information was very good and immediately useful in my
 answers only part of it also hardly no participation
 exams come straight from the book
 let go and never teach again he takes forever
 taking a class with dr zafar right now
 the most offensive professor i have ever taken
 group project
 not too bad as long as you
 and you dont have to learn much
 do not take this class with this
 class is laid back and she has
 two assignments a week but they
 take a while to post grades
 for an online
 slow to grade
 you think like him youll
 this course was very challenging
 this class wasnt too difficult
 dr toombs
 the book cover to cover
 pay attention to due dates
 he doesnt care about you
 professor ingram
 an online class
 discussion board
 keep up with the work
 if your answer doesnt match with what he thinks
 b almost an a i would definitely take him
 gives c ds on work based on subjective assignments
 fail if you give it half a try read
 this class if shes the professor her classes should
 professor this was my first semester at the university
 those who try really hard to get as like
 course and not too hard overall i enjoyed this
 can be challenging but if you skim the book
 4 people in each group average in difficulty good
 know how to teach this course its an entry
 discusses the project however the final week he begins
 mkt 501 online course he meets online by voice
 sure you get the book be ready to pull
 it was a complete nightmare he has no idea
 overwhelming but if you do your assignments weekly it
 the workload is not bad at all and you
 very interesting she is always willing to help you
 but with posts case reports it all balances out
