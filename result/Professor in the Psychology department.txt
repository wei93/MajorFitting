 100 mih speed total time she takes to teach
 him for this class one suggestion do the papers
 to take this doctoral level course thenif so good
 tells some extremely interesting stories i had no interest
 she opens slides that she has not ssen before
 has difficulty communicating explanation confusing she got defensive not
 chat it up with him there was a mistake
 not easy but she does everything to help you
 no interest in the subject before the class but
 with him take him he can be pretty sarcastic
 i learned a lot and highly recommend prof kelly
