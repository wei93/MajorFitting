 economics
 go to 40 and go
 he had two 50 questionsmultiple choice test some truefalse
 class i have ever taken it was a lot
 problem and say with a little 8th grade math
 if i had the opportunity to take her again
 math you get the answer he doesnt show you
 online book and supplemental readings then you should be
 the amount of work done is very extensive she
 help you at all hell start off a problem
 this class is selfstudy with only couple of hours
 them interesting and you learn a great deal from
 dr ballard
 if you have to take this course
 be ready to study and do the work
 class live
 study plan
 respond to emails in a timely manner
 do not take this professor his lectures
 expects students to read self study perform
 his summer on line class was fast
 your lowest test grade
 the most difficult course i have
 in the class understands the material
 what he is saying he does
 she gives out worksheets in class
 billur was a great professor she
 does care about the students but
 and is always willing to help he
 get used to it
 is easily one of my favorite professors
 he knows what hes doing
 straight from the textbook
 has an accent that
 you will learn nothing in
 the homework and extra credit
 to cover all the material
 do the extra credit work
 not good at teaching it
 funny his lectures are kind
 easy but thats because you
 and tries to make class
 if you attend the class
 ended up having to qdrop
 needs to curve his tests
 office hours in the library
 real world examples to explain
 so if you do well
 really hard to pay attention
 get an a its not
