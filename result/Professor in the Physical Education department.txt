 impossible to get an a unless
 to take a kinesiology class for
 i had her for water aerobics
 classes are always easy as long as you show
 difference cool instructor who likes to teach students about
 youll definitely learn a lot from him in all
 easiest class i have ever taken fun class nice
 and cannot say if she is hot or not
 he makes class fun but the trips are terrible
 fun he teaches the basic strokes and gives extra
 difficult and do not necessarily cover what she says
 professor ive ever had if we had an option
 tests he doesnt do abcd lol and if you
 easy annd relaxing class the prof was really sweet
 tough but he usually goes back and adds points
 gives a bunch of information and lectures are very
 have to study i loved her and would take
 funny too after being in his class awhile he
 corrective advice and instruction covered all test material completely
 would definitely take her again but not my major
 without it everything you need to study comes from
 get a good grade written tests are easy if
 only is she cool but shes attractive gotta love
 take any excuses test are tough just allowed 20
 applicable his classes in the ses department have everything
 super helpful and very passionate about her field super
 text do well on the assignme great class lots
 end of class assignments although she talks very fast
 and she is really into her yoga she can
 partner and then have to do a health lesson
 of articles to read she does a good job
 in order to receive an a on the tests
 there is no reason you should get anything less
 and learning something along the way in his classes
 a personal defense class just show up on time
 for kine 120 and she had no idea what
 the material thoroughly and there will be quizzes thornton
 after themselves sticks tightly to the attendance and tests
 be tardy it is better to not come than
 a great swim coach i took his intermediate swim
 very interesting class but also very in depth study
 reading material i never use the book in her
 study or show up you will fail mr dillon
 situations and knowledge to the classroom his tests ensure
 as a former coach coach haasl cares immensely about
 on the final fiaud is a genius very interesting
 but when they are given they are time consuming
 shooting rounds and stuff nice guy who helps me
 job took her over the summer i feel like
 at all lectures are good but way too much
