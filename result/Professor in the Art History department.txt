 took this class online and it was
 he teaches in a way that everyone can comprehend
 way that she can i highly recommend this professor
 make sure you study for the test she does
 be read then he gives you review sheets that
 very last minute on posting most of the lectures
 helpful informative class was challenging but rewarding high strung
 and very very few notes if any to take
 class because some of the movies had historic references
 tested in is talked about in class and its
 if you are in class you will never need
 knows her stuff but she isnt very clear cut
 i have ever had she puts up a hard
 b dr rote is a great professor who i
 none with words his accent is horrible wouldnt recomened
 you want a show in the middle of uninteresting
 but learned very little this lady is a nut
 is she pulls from her long lectures i just
 ridiculous no reason to have that much homework dont
 highly reccomend her she is so selfish and nothing
 of how frequently she would get off topic all
 class just the basic stuff about a certain piece
 recomened the class is easy as long as you
 amazing prof he knows the material inside and out
 questions students may have moreover she is very willing
 of pictures i dont suggest you take him easy
 on the review because that the answer shes looking
 pass if it werent for the curve that you
 prepared to stretch your creative muscles in this class
 get but just be warned these tests are ridiculous
 life experiences shes a fascinating personi would recommend this
 shes looking for shes extremely unorganized and is inconsistent
 assignment were super easy and not time consuming quizzes
 extremely rude and insulting to students borders on being
 is mc and short answer thomas really knows her
 you keep up on her assignments study and actually
 her class is easy but shes not very understanding
 to memorize her test it is a written test
 him very easy and willing to help you if
 un easy a she gives detailed reviews in class
 will have a difficult time passing the tests without
 recommend taking your textbook and reading the chapters its
 there is no longer si sessions if you go
 straightforward pay attention to her reviews lectures are clear
 would quote her any day great teacher enthusiastic helpful
 the lectures and does not grade quickly she didnt
 class has a lot of work and im willing
 back and the tests are easy there is one
 his classroom thank you good sir great guy you
