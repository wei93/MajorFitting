 the back of the book
 the gas will be your best
 random things she says in class
 also the weekly online assignments can be very time
 summer but i definitely would recommend to take him
 class if you need help on the homework there
 amazing human beings ive ever met he really cares
 i love this teacher shes so full of energy
 the course needs a lot of work and its
 there for you there is an html project so
 a great guy who cares about his students if
 the homework with no real surprises he only teaches
 work you should be good overall class is tough
 in assignments on time i didnt and that was
 cares about the students and he really just wants
 tests just extra information for your own knowledge lots
 will ask random questions about what she said in
 english major worth taking for the information but not
 test bank but trust me it doesnt really help
 even though i missed 2 of the 10 submissions
 you dont like computers a lot of the random
 50 put together his accent might be slightly hard
 a decent professor who is willing to help only
 she is highly enthusiastic and entertaining however she really
 effort just show up and pay attention theresa phinney
 homework and study you can get an a in
 flexible with grades as long as youre respectful toward
 a long question with one very small seemingly irrelevant
 this class is pretty easy the tests are basically
 so you dont have a hard time on tests
 is not a bad prof she tries her best
 are some questions that she puts in the exams
 me honestly just look over the test bank in
 idea also she gives class quizzes a lot so
 lot gives extra credit based on random attendance lists
 you have to have it dont miss class she
 straw was when he screwed the whole class by
 the class is heavy on memorization just make sure
 forget to do them tests are long and not
 he makes attendance mandatory by taking attendance of giving
 watch videos in class a lot which are boring
 learning then your test grades tests are only worth
 is a relatively easy class test questions come straight
 can be hard and lectures are long and detailed
 sure youre memorizing the right answer harder than in
 something completely opposite the next day the final straw
 access and excel through promethous youll have a test
 never got clarity hed say one thing and something
 tough to sit through at all excel and access
 so many times throughout the semester would send obscure
