 write down everything he says in class no notes
 are easy but actually requires reviewing notes in detail
 over plays are easy if you read do not
 quizzes over plays
 you go to class and take good notes youll
 need the textbook as long as you
 she gives a review
 and quizzes are online
 straight from the lecture slides
 dr ahlgren is a very
 she posts the slides online
 there is no reason not
 it was so much fun
 for extra credit she gives
 this class is highly recommended
 an easy a easiest class
 she cancels class
 were fairly interesting and i didnt skip class extra
 we didnt get out of class at least 20
 thats how pathetic of a grader he is i
 to really read through each question attendance isnt taken
 of knowledge that could be crammed into a class
 this class if you want to boost your gpa
 500 total points its about the easiest class ive
 because her tests are basically directly from lectures otherwise
 didnt have more classes with kelly kelly is absolutely
 may give extra credits for students in class if
 quizzes are super easy and the class is actually
 really love speech you use the textbook daily test
 i have taken at tamucc alison is about as
 could possibly lead to his being seen as gruff
 in papers and youll get a a no problem
 and the test is pretty much the review you
 up your grade while needing to take an arts
 gist of it and still do well on these
 interesting take her not a hard class as long
 past semester and i cant begin to express how
 hard class in the department but i found that
 and quirky her class was fairly boring just because
 performing 1 childrens poem 1 short story and 1
 take attendance but i genuinely enjoyed all her lectures
 have no problems on the tests just make sure
 integrated arts for elementary teaching he was the best
 she was very easy professor miller was easily one
 when in reality shes from small east texas town
 expects you to do the same attendence is very
 she gave me an 89 and i was there
 in every other first test ive had thus far
 guerins class shes really funny we had four tests
