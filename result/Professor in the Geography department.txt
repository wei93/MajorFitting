 geography
 go to the si
 at first but by far one of the best
 and she drops the lowest one
 the maps
 will have to use google earth a lot
 be easy but i was completely wrong
 and take advantage of the extra credit
 as long as you attend the lectures
 do well on the first 3 exams
 seems to be the least important
 dr hugill
 dr ewers
 id take him again for sure
 need to read the book but
 doesnt show up
 laid back and willing to help
 read the textbook
 and will clarify again if
 first test is the hardest
 take someone else his class
 and hope for the best
 dr frauenfeld
 to get an overall good
 pop quizzes
 you should be fine
 easily do not take the online class the quizzes
 the subject is just hard to get interested in
 you study the notes i was happy i took
 so boring and most days i walked out without
 worksheets on grades based on her own opinions not
 and i would take another class from him his
 final grade was curved when i took the class
 exams and 1 easy project attendance is taken randomly
 can seem very long hes a very helpful person
 the lab which was pretty basic its a pretty
 important material for tests if you dont the only
 seem boring in his lectures but if you truly
 taking notes and listening at the same time can
 we suggest all the bims majors take it do
 end no do not take his class the content
 if you pay attention in class i really liked
 very funny prof but his tests are extremely hard
 the end we learned a lot about the weather
 worth while i took his class over the summer
 by pearson his tests arent too difficult i got
 lecture without power points a little left of center
 class and the labs are pretty intense this class
 to learn basic gis in the beginning it sounded
 have extra instruction i was interested in the subject
