 semester dr nikki did not only teach the course
 that i was able to learn new things about
 odd person out she is responsible for 100 business
 from the book once you figure out the format
 taught other computer skills which are critical to every
 professor throughout my college career avoid taking her she
 course i wonder how these 100 students will do
 with little to no project feedback or direction 7
