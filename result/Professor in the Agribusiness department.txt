 and i was absolutely blown away he can talk
 hard and you might make a b youve got
 of a math class for 2 years and taking
 that if you take good notes and pay attention
 notes this guy is hard the kind of prof
 going to challenge you just when you think youve
 the only problem is his lectures kind of drag
 pop quizzes are once a week so look over
 didnt focus too much on but i will admit
 to learn it then he can teach you dr
 me everything in his lecture is fair game for
 go over a lot but add any of his
 can be extremely condescending and teaches an intro class
 his class hes not easy but does care about
 notes several times not an easy course but youll
 but the course is interesting and so is he
 however lukefahr is not a great teacher hes difficult
 and the other 25 things he says this makes
 almost once a week and uses plenty of examples
 animals nonstop he is the einstein of the animal
 a question he tells you its in the book
 quotlabsquot he also does powerpoints my advice for passing
 challenge but definitely achievable just forces you to pay
 are crazy interesting the class in itself is really
 tests and quizzes are difficult if you dont look
 powerpoints all the time and his tests are 75
 which he reads off of for a good portion
 on only because he just does powerpoints which he
 one thing on the test that you didnt focus
 is take it at the community college but if
 him was a breeze he is very detailed in
 an easy a this is the kind of class
 is he there is one major drawback he uses
 are your thing you just might have found your
 quizzes everything just take lots of notes his powerpoints
 book or in the lecture notes no kidding sherlock
 to pay attention this was the first college course
 size small to have one on one with his
 sherlock holmes if your looking to take animal science
 get honest reviewer here he is brilliant and go
 to utilize the study guides he posts on his
 ever taken and i was absolutely blown
 work in his class hes not easy
 a this is the kind of class
 study guides he posts on his website
 lots of notes his powerpoints go over
 6 years ago great class loved working
 kind of class thats going to challenge
 easy but does care about the students
 reviewer here he is brilliant and go
