 dr toback is by far
 isnt the best at explaining himself sometimes so if
 in lecture but tries to make it interesting i
 speak up and its very cold and dark in
 and never tells you how to use them his
 noise when leaving this guys team won a nobel
 i went to a few of his office hours
 science credit take entomology oceanography or astronomy with another
 is an awesome professor who shares some really interesting
 course he makes astronomy very fun attendance was not
 gives 3 noncumulative tests he is a really cool
 hes very nice i can be funny at times
 talented and listens super well to you loves big
 relays it so that you can understand it hes
 big bang theory exactly actually i agree with all
 your life to hear the kinds of stories he
 physics it will be hard regardless of who you
 very easy going best teacher ive had at this
 questions would not recommend to anyone if youre looking
 knowledgeable about what he teaches toback is a blessing
 that makes it easy to grasp basically derives equations
 questions prof suntzeff is very knowledgable in astronomy but
 bang black hole no math with no previous experience
 to get through this course the material is difficult
 to lighten up lecture with some pretty funny joke
 and tests are mostly from the homework questions overall
 and entertaining professor out there the best thing about
 had the chance the rudest professor i have had
 and does not teach the material in a way
 you review that you should make a good grade
 essay he is an amazing professor that honestly loves
 the homeworks without cracking open the book but if
 if you read the chapters he assigns and pay
 clear when explaining the material and helpful when you
 what you are learning he is a busy man
 the tests so you have to teach yourself everything
 and yet was always fighting the urge during his
 grade they deserve exams are very difficult but fairly
 really hard and did well but ended up borderline
 him is whats hard drwilliams is a great professor
 genuinely wants you to understand and appreciate the material
 dr williams is an excellent instructor he is exceptionally
 bang class is fantastic and his lectures can get
 reccoment webb is a very boring lecturer and does
 the only curves were for scores way below average
 that wants everyone to learn and enjoy our vast
 helpful with papers no tests no final no midterm
 ask for a winnie the pooh impression youll thank
 during his lectures id avoid great professor teachers very
