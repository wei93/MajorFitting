 harder than the level she lectures at
 the project is super easy
 hard to sit down with to view exams dont
 lectures are long and kind of boring the tests
 she doesnt really give you much help when you
 or extra credit its not the worst but not
 her tests are identical to her notes you just
 your grade plus after you get the mandatory 25
 the slides because he doesnt give a review i
 being said she had lots of give me points
 on the surface level of the material in class
 to emails really difficult class due to the amount
 i took three years of nutrition in high school
 a lot of time trying to memorize small details
 not super important content wise there are clicker questions
 the diet analysis project could save your grade go
 she does her best to give you the most
 you a study guide for each test but you
 boring so i tend to zone out super fast
 were posted online and were quite lengthy there were
 not an easy class shes a very sweet lady
 is very helpful in her office hours the tests
 for iclicker questions all the other points count as
 the tests hard you basically have to know everything
 test will still be really hard good luck dr
 study you should make at least a high c
 topic from one to another if you are wanting
 but plenty of cushion with other grades she gives
 others may have different opinions but i wouldnt retake
 in your wellbeing and grade always willing to help
 if you took the time to look through your
 this class and the big project is easy not
 to her office hours shes willing to be helpful
 the book and study the notes you take in
 an easy bump to your gpa take it tests
 grade go to class everyday and take very good
 dont buy any books the class is hard there
 and boosted everyones grade overall i recommend taking dr
 dr creasy is a wonderful sweet woman with that
 25 required clicker question points any points above 25
 to memorize but overall the course wasnt too bad
 you just have to have a very good memory
 very interesting and you will learn a lot study
 were also weekly online quizzes that were free as
 recommend her she is the sweetest lady but her
 big grade booster follow the directions and its an
 day ask questions she really wants to help you
 curved me to an a really difficult to pay
 just very boring lecture if you need an easy
 to get an a but you have to pay
 study the learning objectives
 easy project at the end
 take advantage of those her tests are normally averages
 you her powerpoint and you fill it in as
 textbook is required only for the access code for
 is taken and it matters one midterm final basically
 you study and do all of the assignments her
 on a test idk if its just me overthinking
 info is bolded i loved geismar she was so
 cumulative plus a project that is easy i took
 dietary project which is an easy a if you
 class to fill in the blanks for your notes
 need requires a clicker pop quizzes and attendance recorded
 it is helpful to go to class she also
 on the presentation pages she gives you for each
 speaker everyday and fill out a presentation page attendance
 she is my favorite professor shes very passionate about
 student who gets normally all as and this class
 the semester very interesting class and wonderful prof would
 the iclickers but she lets you use your notes
 i got as on every test there are pop
 the tests the tests themselves are straightforward so long
 are fun he doesnt take attendance but dont skip
 but if you do the class should be easy
 of the tests youre kind of screwed this class
 listen to and ends class early every day i
 always gives hints for test questions shes so weird
 and above is considered an a i defiantly would
 exams are not too bad if you do learning
 just pay attention then you will learn a lot
 take pictures of the clicker count questions and use
 the lectures interesting this class was extremely easy only
 ecampus she tells you exactly what to study for
 this anything she says twice in class will mostly
 to an online program for a project she gives
 easiest class i have ever taken i loved this
 class once she had speakers come in every day
 out the lecture notes the is honestly the easiest
 subject that translates in her teaching tests werent bad
 good there is also a super easy project thats
 interesting however she gives lots of pop quizzes so
 be there oops she is a really great professor
 highly recommend on taking her class also use studyblue
 is also easy the work required for this seminar
 basically split up into first second semester speakers one
 shouldve and it definitely cost me shes a great
 dr chapkin is a good professor funny and keeps
 it was more like college 101 she only taught
 i would look into a diff prof i loved
 if you study i absolutely loved karen geismar she
