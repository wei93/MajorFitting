 i have taken for journalism so much to learn
 cant stand her hannah is a very intelligent professor
 goes on if you come to class take notes
 are a younger student was told by him he
 and she tends to talk to her students like
 material well enough for understanding also she plays favorites
 follow the syllabussince he is the only one teaching
 gets boring the teacher makes for great eyecandy jaime
 on his quizzes or all essay tests but you
 a difficult class in photo journalism but the instructor
 this but she was not a good teacher she
 on it he gives nothing but essay tests in
 make those classes up too she ruined my gpa
 if you take notes and study vocab do well
 videos we discuss what we see i actually prefer
 teach the class a ga does no review in
 smart he expects you to read and learn but
 and early lectures were all over the place but
 take uni studies course and a great gpa booster
 can be an easy f if you never show
 office chats are fun quotwhos your photo daddy63quot hahahahahahahahaha
 easy class and mr stewart is awesome mr stewart
 effectively convey this information to students he truly cares
 be educated that digital cameras are cameras too his
 a great friendly teacher who is willing to help
 well and you can accept your grade without worrying
 she can help you get a good job shes
 and effective manner he seems like he is too
 classa must to take take jour 114 for one
 kicked me out for forgetting notebook even though i
 a lot in the end i love dr bridges
 on expectations overall the class was enjoyable and educational
 class has 2 easy writing assignments and 4 tests
 the tests your good cool class very interesting take
 but dr bridges knows his stuff and you will
 assignments you really have to work in this class
 position and never learns a damn thing from tons
 an a he is a great professor you will
 she says or listen with all the ummms if
 gave me anxiety he was not helpful the class
 really cares but he talks very monatone and it
 always discusses material with you he wants and deserves
 actually prefer essay tests so i thought that part
 professor but make sure you pay attention in class
 requires everyone to take off their hats and put
 doubt an easy a you pay attention and do
 along with great university studies classnot alot of work
