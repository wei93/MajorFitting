 speeches
 public speaking
 a variety of teaching methods and assignments she
 if youre looking for an easy a this
 as long as you did the work
 all of the material in class so
 one of the best classes i have taken
 this class over the summer so
 she is a hard grader
 she will call you out
 she makes you work for your
 i would definitely take this class again
 it was a class that
 is one big group project
 on whats going on in

 him a while to get
 class discussion so speak up
 comm
 youll get an a if you
 easy class she
 to know her and she will help you she
 you need to do etc i would take his
 class making his lectures about text book material so
 enjoy a nice b or with little to no
 the major projects until the very end so its
 really comfortable offers tons of extra credit and even
 class in the summer she knows what shes talking
 classes usually end early and this past summer session
 passports to use while taking exams i wouldnt call
 borrow a friends if you can for when you
 look over my notes the night before and have
 need to go to his class bc hes boring
 this woman shes willing to help and genuinely cares
 class is over all an easy one just do
 to teach and he makes sure to live up
 and extremely arrogant although his classes are easy they
 or cramming for the test will not be fun
 is mandatory but there are usually quizzes every week
 his class you are missing out very personable teaches
 matter what you did it still wasnt enough next
 if you have any problems highly recomended eh this
 ffa for 2yrs in a row and had given
 of the semester there are no tests and no
