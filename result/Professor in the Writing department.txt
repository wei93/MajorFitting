 but cannot teach and doesnt remember what he says
 highpowered lawyerchick swagger about her i dont know how
 word use and he assigns readings in the redbook
 a more welcoming opendoor policy always go to him
 in teaching 1ls the fundamentals of larw very helpful
 she would tell us how we should put something
 papers didnt make sense not very helpful when it
 does a nice job making class fun i thought
 and ask questions nasty grader very unfair a nice
 the school definitely agree that she has the swag
 to what she says in class she tells you
 something and when you do shell count off other
 him with questions great with email picky on grammar
 and youll be fine shes cool just a little
 for understanding really nice guy class is boringbut thats
 good job with teaching writing for memos but needs
 see her to for questions she is very helpful
 it but its really hot shes totally pepperworthy p
 but completely unfair try to get on his good
 very unfair can be funny and appear to be
 undoubtably pepper worthy probably the best larw teacher at
 doing exactly what she said the way she graded
 he definitely knows his stuff he does at times
 straight up and tell you what to do take
 ahead of time you will do well he also
 just do your work on time and follow your
 out of three classes with her i got two
 law and intellectual law but is useless in teaching
 be assigned this guy as a 1l so theres
 to transfer out of his class but couldnt run
 alot about what she wants but go see her
 her if you have problems she will be straight
 i loved professor k he cares about each student
 bc he expects his students to come to law
 responds quickly to all emails and understands the stress
 1l year ok shes rediculously hard ill admit out
 but needs work in the trial brief area she
 his thoughts organized thinks hes cute but hes not
 he is a very sweet person he is easily
 i really enjoyed professor paulis class she has passion
 at the expense of your grade rank and sleep
 people but if you use his office hours he
 get the papers back for weeks while hes trashing
 in your papers because shell tell you to improve
 hard on your memos its difficult to tell what
 know the students wants everyone to do well if
 person but do exactly what she wants and follow
 the rules ask him for advice it will make
 better no comments good prof works hard and checks
 writing class wont fail you but hard to get
