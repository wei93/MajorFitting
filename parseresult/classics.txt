 if you daze off in lecture you might get
 will give you practice on things if you need
 easy professor a lot of reading but its easy
 so you could print them out and take notes
 he provides you should pass the lectures were interesting
 to understand does have powerpoints but they jump all
 three more semesters after this of latin but as
 major shes great and i highly recommend her great
 class everyday read the reading ever night and before
 long as i have her i think i can
 go to class only two tests and the final
 while you can pass without reading you would just
 later in the semester that said he can talk
 very knowledgeable and gets excited about what hes teaching
 lots of reading but as long as you do
 time and he ended class early pretty often esp
 reading assignments are long and summaries are decent enough
 do the very specific exam reviews he posts online
 miss class and always lets you make up quizzes
 also good at throwing humor into lessons a lot
 up quizzes or assignments if you take latintake this
 and he wouldnt round or give extra credit you
 who sparked my interest in classics which is now
 exactly the test the reading is important but there
 prof at am have had her for 3 semesters
 lost only 2 exams and 1 cumulative final hes
 readings are long but doable if you pay attention
 and youll have no problems this class was fun
 easy but shes always willing to help and will
 if you like greek mythology you will enjoy this
 not understand the material however she is pretty lenient
 just be making things harder on yourself do the
 class he gave a test review which was pretty
 extremely difficult even when the reading is completed passage
 before the tests and still did very poorly i
 knows so much about latin and she is always
 two points away from a d on my final
 she is the best and so helpful and kind
 and listen to his lectures and the class can
 tests are easy and he makes the material quite
 does and she truly cares about her students willing
 are decent enough lots of reading but as
 the lectures were interesting most of the time
 she is always willing to help you have
 review which was pretty much exactly the test
 lectures and the class can be quite enjoyable
 great teacher his tests are easy and he
 the tests and still did very poorly i
 passionate and knowledgable tests are extremely difficult even
 go to class or else you will not
