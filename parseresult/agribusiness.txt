 and i was absolutely blown away he can talk
 hard and you might make a b youve got
 of a math class for 2 years and taking
 that if you take good notes and pay attention
 notes this guy is hard the kind of prof
 going to challenge you just when you think youve
 the only problem is his lectures kind of drag
 pop quizzes are once a week so look over
 didnt focus too much on but i will admit
 to learn it then he can teach you dr
 me everything in his lecture is fair game for
 go over a lot but add any of his
 can be extremely condescending and teaches an intro class
 his class hes not easy but does care about
 honest reviewer here he is brilliant and go on
 notes several times not an easy course but youll
 but the course is interesting and so is he
 however lukefahr is not a great teacher hes difficult
 and the other 25 things he says this makes
 almost once a week and uses plenty of examples
 a question he tells you its in the book
 quotlabsquot he also does powerpoints my advice for passing
 challenge but definitely achievable just forces you to pay
 are crazy interesting the class in itself is really
 tests and quizzes are difficult if you dont look
 powerpoints all the time and his tests are 75
 which he reads off of for a good portion
 on only because he just does powerpoints which he
 one thing on the test that you didnt focus
 is take it at the community college but if
 him was a breeze he is very detailed in
 an easy a this is the kind of class
 are your thing you just might have found your
 book or in the lecture notes no kidding sherlock
 to pay attention this was the first college course
 size small to have one on one with his
 sherlock holmes if your looking to take animal science
 be to utilize the study guides he posts on
 willing to help great prof you need
 things he says this makes getting an
 and the other 25 things he says
 your notes several times not an easy
 i will admit that if you take
 can teach you dr lukefahrs class has
 is one major drawback he uses powerpoints
 be to utilize the study guides he
 focus too much on but i will
 question he tells you its in the
 uses plenty of examples if you need
 is interesting and so is he there
