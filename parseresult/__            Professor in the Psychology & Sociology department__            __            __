 i had anticipated even after spending an hour a
 way to hard also very grumpy and not helpful
 dr lench was a good teacher but she was
 take notes and learn the formulas and interpretations youll
 good notes and be prepared for many essays on
 recommend going to class as she sometimes says things
 the material she is extremely helpful on anything you
 really helps be prepared to learn to write to
 and do well however the textbook must be read
 them in exams this is probably the greatest professor
 on the night before our exams and still made
 but the lab portions was awful the lab had
 welldefined psychology in my opinion is a soft science
 was very hard attendance isnt mandatory and she posts
 ridiculous and they obviously did not try in this
 where the average grade was a 40 she did
 pass i got an a but it took a
 her powerpoints online but i would highly recommend going
 about it makes tests way harder than they need
 problem need to read to do well on tests
 lot of studying is required this class was much
 lench really gets stats and that shows in her
 a was funny kept class interesting slides posted online
 on the material i scored no higher than a
 are hard even though she is specific about what
 this class and the tests are very in depth
 for interpretations she trys to make stats fun but
 and i usually got an a on them but
 she is a little tough on tests but only
 had impossible quizzes and horrible papers to write where
 quizzes werent that hard and she sometimes recycles questions
 suit good class tests were hard but everything was
 her tests are pretty straight forward but you have
 class no curve at the end of the course
 to read textbook but she is very helpful wants
 only because she wants you to know the material
 made high as just by reading the book carefully
 curve taking only the highest quizzes and writing assignments
 of class questions on tests and quizzes are unclear
 did not care about the struggle in the lab
 in this class lectures are not mandatory but she
 not like this class at all her test were
 notes from class all tests have essays take good
 she makes it fun take her class is very
 took a huge amount of studying to do so
 is probably the greatest professor ever she is
 a huge amount of studying to do so
 she sometimes says things that arent on powerpoints
 and studying my notes from class her quizzes
 c on all of my exams the questions
