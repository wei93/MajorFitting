 spit back what he spits out
 to relearn some things and not getting a full
 you understand or notvery strict grading on written exams
 your grade because it goes into hw grade attendance
 busy work she forgets she isnt our only class
 youll want to do well on everything great professor
 or text it will not be welcomed its quotcopy
 read the materialyou can probably pass with sparknotes but
 read the book its very important to study but
 only in the textbook so i would recommend doing
 not the dept chair he lectured most of the
 loves group projects and many assignments in one timeframe
 helping students if you do not miss a single
 makes learning classic literature fun shes a very charismatic
 semester i highly recommend this professor i had her
 that he is not teaching english 101 anymore i
 the student did not get all their assignments graded
 get an a any other way great teacher get
 subject she teaches the class isnt too hard you
 read but the readings are fun and simple attendance
 a pretty interesting and funny guy too he kept
 little awkward lots of reading tests are not too
 her field i would definitely recommend her i learned
 to help students and involved in making productive comments
 if you didnt read that nights assignment it sure
 make up a big chunk of your grade you
 is normal for lit classes but he is pretty
 dr morton knows her stuff she expects you to
 was rude and boring ive enjoyed this class it
 to class itll be worth it she makes class
 not getting the material poor interest in actually teaching
 read the textbook put real effort into the papers
 id recommend him for anyone who needs this class
 summer so unsure how he is during a regular
 exam 5 project 10 final 15 dr morton assigned
 big deal do not add anything extra to any
 you could do well on the tests easily but
 what he teaches wants you to love it as
 but it wasnt hard to make an a when
 a she did allow some corrections to be made
 most classes were group discussions he is very patient
 english course and he made it easy for me
 my only problem is that the class was 2
 from up north do not try and add anything
 class thats what you do in all i think
 the class the material covered and the approach he
 great professor clear grader you must understand the readings
 everything i hoped it to be dr tuerk has
 over he was very helpful and i was able
 grade things in a timely manner and loves group
