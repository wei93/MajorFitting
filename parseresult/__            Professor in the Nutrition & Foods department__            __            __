 study the learning objectives
 class to fill in the
 easy project at the end
 to study but an a is possible textbook is
 take advantage of those her tests are normally averages
 you her powerpoint and you fill it in as
 textbook is required only for the access code for
 is taken and it matters one midterm final basically
 you study and do all of the assignments her
 on a test idk if its just me overthinking
 info is bolded i loved geismar she was so
 cumulative plus a project that is easy i took
 dietary project which is an easy a if you
 need requires a clicker pop quizzes and attendance recorded
 it is helpful to go to class she also
 meet up overall go to class and do the
 on the presentation pages she gives you for each
 speaker everyday and fill out a presentation page attendance
 she is my favorite professor shes very passionate about
 student who gets normally all as and this class
 the semester very interesting class and wonderful prof would
 the iclickers but she lets you use your notes
 i got as on every test there are pop
 the tests the tests themselves are straightforward so long
 are fun he doesnt take attendance but dont skip
 but if you do the class should be easy
 of the tests youre kind of screwed this class
 listen to and ends class early every day i
 always gives hints for test questions shes so weird
 and above is considered an a i defiantly would
 expected it i read the book do all the
 exams are not too bad if you do learning
 just pay attention then you will learn a lot
 class and her powerpoints have blanks you need to
 tests too mandatory to go to class due to
 take pictures of the clicker count questions and use
 the lectures interesting this class was extremely easy only
 ecampus she tells you exactly what to study for
 because its a lot of info and reading the
 this anything she says twice in class will mostly
 to an online program for a project she gives
 easiest class i have ever taken i loved this
 class once she had speakers come in every day
 contain all of the information you need for the
 out the lecture notes the is honestly the easiest
 subject that translates in her teaching tests werent bad
 good there is also a super easy project thats
 wasnt enough for the exams the group project is
 be there oops she is a really great professor
 highly recommend on taking her class also use studyblue
