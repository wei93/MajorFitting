 tough class i took her in the summer where
 instructor and very helpful excellent instructor i enjoyed his
 students for the type of material or questions on
 quiz are not covered in the reading you have
 get a decent grade anyone who has a good
 chapter helped with the test there is no textbook
 grade great instructor very thorough and helpful awesome professor

 accounting this is great because it allows students to
 email which was a huge plus during an accelerated
 the exams are not bad had one quiz befor
 his own scheduled lectures and was difficult to get
 her a good teacher she gives quizzes before explaining
 he goes by what the syllabus says not what
 taken there are no lectures and the only requirements
 way the quiz problems were worded were not the
 concepts clearly and knows the material well he is
 test to pass the class and transfer credits worst
