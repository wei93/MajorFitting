 but cannot teach and doesnt remember what he says
 some bc he expects his students to come to
 highpowered lawyerchick swagger about her i dont know how
 word use and he assigns readings in the redbook
 she really cares for her students and makes a
 a more welcoming opendoor policy always go to him
 in teaching 1ls the fundamentals of larw very helpful
 she would tell us how we should put something
 papers didnt make sense not very helpful when it
 you can do but deal with him he is
 does a nice job making class fun i thought
 and ask questions nasty grader very unfair a nice
 the school definitely agree that she has the swag
 to what she says in class she tells you
 something and when you do shell count off other
 him with questions great with email picky on grammar
 and youll be fine shes cool just a little
 for understanding really nice guy class is boringbut thats
 good job with teaching writing for memos but needs
 see her to for questions she is very helpful
 it but its really hot shes totally pepperworthy p
 you not to do and you dont get the
 will be straight up and tell you what to
 but completely unfair try to get on his good
 very unfair can be funny and appear to be
 undoubtably pepper worthy probably the best larw teacher at
 doing exactly what she said the way she graded
 he definitely knows his stuff he does at times
 and he will be nice to you grading is
 ahead of time you will do well he also
 just do your work on time and follow your
 out of three classes with her i got two
 law and intellectual law but is useless in teaching
 be assigned this guy as a 1l so theres
 to transfer out of his class but couldnt run
 rank papers that are so alike pay attention to
 alot about what she wants but go see her
 considerate polite person but grades nasty you become a
 i loved professor k he cares about each student
 responds quickly to all emails and understands the stress
 1l year ok shes rediculously hard ill admit out
 that shes extremely nice helpful and cares about the
 but needs work in the trial brief area she
 his thoughts organized thinks hes cute but hes not
 he is a very sweet person he is easily
 i really enjoyed professor paulis class she has passion
 at the expense of your grade rank and sleep
 people but if you use his office hours he
 get the papers back for weeks while hes trashing
 in your papers because shell tell you to improve
